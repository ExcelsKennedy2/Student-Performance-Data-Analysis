# Student Performance Analysis Using Pandas

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a real-world **student performance dataset** to understand the factors that influence academic outcomes using **Python, Pandas, and data visualization**.

The dataset focuses on Portuguese secondary school students and includes information about:
- Academic performance
- Family background
- Study habits
- Lifestyle and behavioral factors

The primary goal is to identify **key drivers of student success and risk factors for poor performance**, similar to analyses requested by schools, NGOs, researchers, and education-focused organizations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
The objectives of this project are to:

- Clean and prepare an education dataset for analysis  
- Explore relationships between student behavior and academic performance  
- Identify factors that influence final grades  
- Detect at-risk students based on academic and behavioral indicators  
- Visualize trends and patterns to support insights  
- Demonstrate real-world Pandas and data analysis skills

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset (`student-por.csv`) contains the following types of features:

### 📘 Academic Performance
- **G1** – First period grade  
- **G2** – Second period grade  
- **G3** – Final grade (target variable)  
- **studytime** – Weekly study time  
- **failures** – Number of past class failures  
- **absences** – Number of school absences  

### 👪 Family & Support
- **Medu / Fedu** – Parents’ education levels  
- **famsup** – Family educational support  
- **schoolsup** – Extra school support  
- **internet** – Internet access at home  

### 🍺 Lifestyle & Behavior
- **Dalc / Walc** – Alcohol consumption (weekday/weekend)  
- **goout** – Going out with friends  
- **freetime** – Free time after school

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🔍 Data Cleaning & Preparation
The following preprocessing steps were applied:

- Standardized column formats  
- Checked and validated data types  
- Verified absence of missing values  
- Removed unnecessary columns  
- Prepared features for analysis and visualization  

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed
Key analyses conducted in this project include:

- Distribution of final grades (G3)  
- Relationship between study time and academic performance  
- Impact of absences on final grades  
- Effect of parental education on student outcomes  
- Influence of alcohol consumption and social behavior on performance  
- Identification of at-risk students (low G3 scores)  

---

## 📈 Data Visualizations
To support the analysis, multiple visualizations were created, including:

- Histograms of grade distributions  
- Bar charts comparing average grades by study time  
- Scatter plots showing absences vs final grades  
- Box plots comparing performance across behavioral groups  

These visualizations help clearly communicate patterns and trends in the data.

---

## 💡 Key Insights
Some of the insights derived from the analysis include:

- Higher study time is generally associated with better final grades  
- Increased absences strongly correlate with lower academic performance  
- Students with family or school support tend to perform better  
- Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with poorer outcomes  
- Past failures are a strong indicator of future academic risk
